\begin{frame}{Randomized Simulations -- Monte-Carlo Approach}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Random sampling of radius, ovality and shape parameters for 3 distinct particles.
        \item Generation of initial contact state.
        \item Simulation till end time reached or pore closed.
        \item Repeating several hundred times and collecting results.
        \item Easy parallelization due to independent simulations.
    \end{itemize}
