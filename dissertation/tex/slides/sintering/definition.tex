    \begin{block}{Sintering}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Is a heat treatment process to alter microstructure of powder compacts for achieving certain properties (mainly mechanical strength).
            \item Is a thermodynamically voluntary process driven by reduction of energy stored in defects (especially surfaces and grain boundaries).
        \end{itemize}

    \structure{The system is in non-equilibrium thermodynamic state and evolves towards equilibrium (seldom ever reaching it).}
