\begin{frame}{Reasoning Behind Current Approach}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Direct Representation] allow adressing of surface relative to particle position \\
            $\rightarrow$ easy rigid body movement
        \item[Sharp Interface] have localized interface energy \\
            $\rightarrow$ have material data invariant to discretization
        \item[Finite Difference Discretization] state of particle interior not needed
        \item[Thermal Extremal Principle Solution] obtain concise near-linear equation system with implicit respect to constraints
