\chapter{Numerical Methods for Sintering Simulation}\label{ch:numerical-methods}

Sintering models can be distinguished in two main branches: macroscale and microscale models.
The former regard the porous workpiece material as a continuum with variable density.
Stresses and strains are usually modelled using visco-plastic material laws or similar while the density evolves during thermal treatment or plastic deformation (mechanical compaction).
Numerical solutions are commonly obtained by use of the \gls{FEM}.
The focus of these models usually lies in the analysis of density, strain and stress distributions, as well as damage estimation, in a component with often complex geometry.
Examples for these models are found in \textcite{Olevsky1998, Safonov2019, Kraft2004, Al-Qudsi2014, Shi2023}.
These models will not be considered in the following, as this work concentrates on the second kind.

Microscale models regard the interaction between distinct grains resp. powder particles and the evolution of their interfaces to each other and the environment.
The solution space typically includes from two to a limited number of distinct particles or a defined \gls{RVE}.

This chapter regards the current state of numerical methods applied to model sintering processes and similar problems.
Interface description is the key problem in microscopic sintering simulation, \cref{sec:interfaces} will concentrate on this topic.
Probabilistic approaches can be used in addition to deterministic methods or replace them entirely, as described in \cref{sec:monte-carlo}.
A concise approach to non-equilibrium thermodynamics is provided by the \gls{TEP}, discussed in \cref{sec:extremal-principle}.
