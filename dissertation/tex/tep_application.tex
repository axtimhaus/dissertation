\chapter{Application of the Thermodynamic Extremal Principle}\label{ch:tep_application}

In the following the generalized extremal principle is applied on the current model of particles and nodes, see \autoref{subsubsec:extremal-priciple-generalized} for details on the approach.
As before, an index of the currently regarded particle or node is neglected where appropriate for brevity.
The indices $\ldots_{\Upper}$ and $\ldots_{\Lower}$ are used to denote the upper resp.~lower neighbor of a node.
${\Nodes}$ is the set of all nodes present in the system and ${\Particles}$ the set of all particles, respectively.
