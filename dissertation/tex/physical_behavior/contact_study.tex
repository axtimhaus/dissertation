\section{Study on the Influence of Multiple Particle Contacts}

Two-particle models lack a major influence on the overall sintering response a material shows: the mutual hindering of particles with multiple contacts.
In reality, particle are not able to move freely due to the requirements of a single grain boundary's evolution.
However, particles form complex contacts were the conditions of all involved contacts have influence on each other.

This study shall demonstrate and evaluate this issue on the example of a regular sphere packing (circle packing in 2D).

\subsection{Construction of the Study}

In a regular packing of equal circles each pore in the packing shows equal evolution due to symmetry.
Two different packings shall be investigated here.
The first is the densest packing of 3 particles achievable, with the third's center above the other's grain boundary.
The
