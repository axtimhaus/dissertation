\chapter{Statistical Powder Modeling} \label{ch:statistical-powder-modeling}

As every particle is unique, the only way to characterize a powder is by statistical quantities, either scalar properties like the mean or by a distribution.
\autoref{sec:powder-characterization} discussed the usual methods of characterizing powders.
In this chapter, a statistical approach directly based on the distribution of size, shape and substance parameters shall be developed to generate inputs for the simulation.
The approach resides on random sampling of particles obeying these distributions.
