\chapter{Randomized Simulation of Particle Packings}\label{ch:randomized-simulations}

In the previous chapter the numerical and physical behavior of the model was analysed.
Thereby, the transition from a two-particle-model to a multi-particle-model was performed.
The results of \cref{sec:contact-study} show, that the effects of pore closure can be incoporated by investigating a particle arrangement of at least three particles.
The sintering behavior of all investigated arrangements was the same except for the region where the pore is almost closed.
Also, the effects of multi-material contacts can be regarded.
In the following investigation, the particle arrangement shall be randomized using statistically generated particles as developed in \cref{sec:statistical-powder-modeling}.
